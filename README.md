# Assignment Hub

## Project Overview

Assignment Hub is an Android application that allows users to upload and manage their assignments. Users can provide details such as the assignment name, cost, and deadline, and also upload a PDF document for each assignment.

This README file was generated by an AI assistant based on its understanding of the project structure and code.

## Key Features

*   **User Authentication:** The application uses Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts, ensuring that only logged-in users can upload assignments.
*   **Assignment Upload:** Users can create new assignment listings by providing the following details:
    *   Assignment Name/Description
    *   Cost
    *   Deadline (selected using a date picker)
    *   A PDF document containing the assignment.
*   **Firebase Integration:** The application is tightly integrated with Firebase services:
    *   **Firebase Realtime Database:** To store structured data for each assignment, including description, cost, deadline, and a reference to the uploaded PDF.
    *   **Firebase Storage:** To store the uploaded PDF files securely.

## Implementation Details

*   **Modern Android Development:** The project is built using modern Android development practices, including:
    *   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
    *   **View Binding:** To safely and easily interact with views.
    *   **ViewModel:** To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    *   **Material Design Components:** For a modern and consistent user interface.
*   **File Upload:** The application handles PDF file selection and uploads them to Firebase Storage. The path to the stored file is then saved in the Firebase Realtime Database along with other assignment details.
